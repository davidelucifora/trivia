## Project Description

Final Solo project assignment of Scrimba's Learn React course. An exercise to consolidate useState and useEffect in React as well as working with APIs.
The game simply pulls 5 or 10 questions from a Trivia API for the user to answer.

### Notes

I would refactor fetching 10 questions regardless rather than re-fetching everytime the user selects 5 or 10. I used the latter approach in this exercise just as a way to practice syncing state at each user's interaction.

## Key Learnings
ReactJS, useState, useEffect, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Figma
